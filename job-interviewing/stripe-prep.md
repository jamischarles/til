### Things to highlight about myself (I'm scrappy) 
`esp for the 'lacking-exp' or skills section...`
You better believe I'll figure it out

Put me on a team where I'm less skilled than everybody else, and I'll work my
tail off until I can provide unique value or I rise up


- Interested in the hidden dynamics of what makes an effort succeed or fail
- hidden power dynamics on a team...
