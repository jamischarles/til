# Why use TypeScript?

## Faster iteration cycles.

Often I have to refresh the page / app to see the shape of the object (if it's
typed I don't have to do that, I can look up the shape in TS with LSP hints).

Then instead of having to refresh to ensure your logic works, you can save and
the compiler will tell you (assuming your codebase is typed enough).
