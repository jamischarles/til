# Finding a good video host for educational content (just starting out)

## Important
- Reliability ()
- fast to start
- avoid buffering
- fast to upload / encode
- good bitrates 
- not too agressive compression (quality doesn't suffer)
- analytics? watch rate? Where did people drop off?

## Bonus
- paid tier / sub management

## Considerations
- big enough / proven enough / trust enough that you won't disappear tomorrow or
are a scam
- is this an add-on product that isn't getting love becaues it's one of 30
products and nor your core business? (Cloudlfare stream)
- how clear is the messaging and marketing? Info easy to get to? 
- how responsive is support?
- pricing & bandwidth limits? 


## Basics of how streaming video differs from a download


- AWS Amplify VOD (video on demand)
- Azure VOD
- DO streaming
- Cloudflare Stream - NO
1) Audio quality was garbled (guessing too aggressive on the compression)
2) Impossible to even find how to contact support for Stream. Every support flow sent me to "domains".

Pricing page was CONFUSING 



Mux (too pricey?)



## Disqualified early
- Vimeo always felt slow to me
- AWS VOD (setup is too complex)
- Wistia (too pricey)


## How each one scored

## One I went with for my purposes...
