# Content & Courses I want to make / ideas

Each of these could be their own mini-site at their own URL. Would that make
sense?

What does the incremental process to these look like?
Small bets approach: Publish 1-3 lessons for each of these, then just move on...
Or 10 lessons?

- JS60. Free-ish course: JavaScript in 60seconds. Lang only. Each lesson is a 60s video max. Short code
samples and explanations. 1 principle at a time. 90% free and capture email?
Give me exercises with broken syntax. Teach the beginner to read the error and
fix it.
- JSCasts. Like railscasts. Weekly videos. With paid tier. For slack &
assistance? Discord community?
- JS101. JS refresher. Just a long page of interactive repl'd exercises.
- explain-the-docs: Go through docs like MDN and explain any page in much
simpler terms. And explain what the terms on the page actually mean.
	- Same for github readme etc...

- Web dev by example. Hacking on webdev. Hacking on JS. Immersion into building
things quickly. Explain later (often). Learn by doing. Literally.

Emphasize: now that you learned X, you could build A,b,c,d, etc 

	- lesson: fix the broken thing. eventListener with ()  (base this on real
	problems my students have had). out of order variables. Global scope
	pollution. JS file runs before the dom is ready. for some let's do
	assertions. For others we can inject & run some JS... Fix the erorr

	- Give me exercises with broken syntax. Teach the beginner to read the error and
	fix it.

## Misc
- HowToAPI. Intro into API calls. curl. postman. etc... Tokens. oAuth. Demo
several APIs. Twitter API and other APIs. Use SW to intercept the ajax requests
in my example? in an iframe?
Use something like this? https://understandlegacycode.com/

## Tools
- show the code execution
- BV -> JS playground...
- explain my code
- show the scope
- explain this error


## YouTube
- Ask an architect series / ask an experienced web dev... Answer technical /
soft questions (like the 1st portfolio)

## Notes / TODO:
Read this principle on learning curve & effort vs reward!!!

## Amazing examples of docs (look at PRINCIPLES to take from them)
Elm docs are amazing
