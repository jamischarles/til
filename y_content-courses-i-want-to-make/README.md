# Content & Courses I want to make / ideas

Each of these could be their own mini-site at their own URL. Would that make
sense?

What does the incremental process to these look like?
Small bets approach: Publish 1-3 lessons for each of these, then just move on...
Or 10 lessons?

- JS60. Free-ish course: JavaScript in 60seconds. Lang only. Each lesson is a 60s video max. Short code
samples and explanations. 1 principle at a time. 90% free and capture email?
- JSCasts. Like railscasts. Weekly videos. With paid tier. For slack &
assistance? Discord community?
- JS101. JS refresher. Just a long page of interactive repl'd exercises.
- explain-the-docs: Go through docs like MDN and explain any page in much
simpler terms. And explain what the terms on the page actually mean.
	- Same for github readme etc...

- Web dev by example. Hacking on webdev. Hacking on JS. Immersion into building
things quickly. Explain later (often). Learn by doing. Literally.

Emphasize: now that you learned X, you could build A,b,c,d, etc 

## Misc
- HowToAPI. Intro into API calls. curl. postman. etc... Tokens. oAuth. Demo
several APIs. Twitter API and other APIs.

## Tools
- show the code execution
- BV -> JS playground...
- explain my code
- show the scope
- explain this error


## YouTube
- Ask an architect series / ask an experienced web dev... Answer technical /
soft questions (like the 1st portfolio)

## Notes / TODO:
Read this principle on learning curve & effort vs reward!!!
