# Home-grown search engine of til repos on github

## Desc
I want to build a search index of all the til repos on github.

## Intial Arch thoughts
- use github API to gather all the `til`-named repos  
- crawl them with my own crawler (or the API)
- Use algolia (or google search api?) to crawl the data and present to user
