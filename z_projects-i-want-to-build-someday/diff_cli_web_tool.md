# Better Diff 

Context aware

TODO: see thread with Vjeux

But really just something that works...
Start with local website on replit?

or CLI...

Just something I can use TOMORROW
To diff requests and minified things from proxyman...

Leapfrog by using established diff algos or libs. Improve LATER
Use github libs?

* Ability to set delimiters for the string so it'll automatically extract
keys&values to compare. 
* ability to ignore order...
