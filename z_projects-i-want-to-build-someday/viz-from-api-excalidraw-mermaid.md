# Automatically generate excalidraw or mermaid graphs from a loop (viz loop

iterations) or code execution paths...

Q: Could we build something out (tool or other) where we have a limited set of
elements at fixed strokes etc...

## Q: What would it take to build a little editor to make these little animations

very quickly and easily? Drag the elements on. Use UI to set timing info.
Generate. Magic! Product?

Use either Excalidraw or mermaid to aumotagically generate diagram from code...
Maybe as a way to viz code excution?

Either for bret victor style viz...

What if it could do that on the fly... MAGIC?

Animated nice viz...?

Similar to nan.fyi... Can we use mermaid to get that kind of output? Just make
it look really nice?
