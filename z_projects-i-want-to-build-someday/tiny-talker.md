# Tiny talker. Wordle style (how it's built, not the UI)

Can I get a V0.1 running on replicate in one hour?

Where I just click the button and it turns either words into speech or it plays my pre-recorded thing. 

Use open source icons. Nice & readable font.


## To explore
- Q: Could we use an alice-style interface for kids to string together a phrase,
connection of verbs & actions visually. Then play it? Could also then save it as
a favorite...?

- Could this double as a "learning to read" app? (Later: replace icons with
words for kids to level up...) Allow it to flip over?

**Related game**: Memory but with words?

## Later:
Could this be a way to have him narrate s story and mirror that?

Really this is a natural language processing cs problem

Make a wordle style tiny talker for miles. Start very simple. Mobile optimized buttons. 

- Open source vocabulary set? Could have workflows...? Usability can increase
over time with PRs 

Config could be set in URL an/or with localstorage. So parents could bookmark
the config. YES.
