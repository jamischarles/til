# Projects I want to build someday

## Related:
- [Skills I want to grow](./skills-i-want-to-grow.md) - Very important to me and my long-term goals 


## TODO:
- [ ] Make a Progress (%) or "complete" or "phase" section. Either in the
filename (prefix?). `DONE_`. `DRAFT_`, `IDEA_` so we can track the phases and
see how many I'm pushing forward. And any that are on the short list.


## Shortlist of next up...
- [Tiny-talker](./tiny-talker.md) - Mobile optimized web app for non-verbial or
autism-spectrum kids. 


## Misc
- Use Lezer to build a custom language parser. Maybe use js error messages or
just make up my own syntax, or use a language that already has one like mermaid
or JS... FUN. and much learning.

## Low value terminal / vim hacking
- rg in terminal needs to show PREVIEW of the file fzf style?
- [ ] Make ls/la with just `path name` and `last-changed` and `size`
- Lua plugin for finding import path. should be able to combine with fzf or fd
to find the path, then you choose to resolve it that way.... Would be nice if it
had some memory for frecency. Like z. YES. For any path, not just for imports.
Relative and absolute... find it and paste it...
- Fix my nvim formatter https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/mrep3l/speedup_your_prettier_formatting_using_prettierd/
- get TAGS WORKING BETTERER... Use lua and hack something together that properly
works. (do some googling, see what features people want. Just do sensible
defaults). EASY to set up and use...
-- see if we can use Coc for this? Must be some sort of integration that already
works based on the LSP...
- fix formatter. make it work for TS files? And other weird cases? 
- rewrite my configs in Lua...? Esp the confusing parts? / parts that don't work
well?
- make a tokyo-based light theme (fork it and just tweak the BG and contrast...)
  - and/or make a high contrast version?
- write my own LSP? For tags at first?
- rg + fzf selector command.
