# Projects I want to build someday

## Related:
- [Skills I want to grow](./skills-i-want-to-grow.md) - Very important to me and my long-term goals 


## TODO:
- [ ] Make a Progress (%) or "complete" or "phase" section. Either in the
filename (prefix?). `DONE_`. `DRAFT_`, `IDEA_` so we can track the phases and
see how many I'm pushing forward. And any that are on the short list.


## Shortlist of next up...
- [Tiny-talker](./tiny-talker.md) - Mobile optimized web app for non-verbial or
autism-spectrum kids. 



## Low value terminal / vim hacking
- [ ] Make ls/la with just `path name` and `last-changed` and `size`
