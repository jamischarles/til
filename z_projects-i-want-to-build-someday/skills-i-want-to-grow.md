# Skills I want to grow

Very important to me and my long-term goals.

Start here, and (as needed) expand out to a dedicated page

## To grow
- Maximizing my leverage points (outsourcing low leverage / value activities of myself)
- Making decisions (better, faster, reflect how it went after)
	- todo make my own framework 
	- include the flowchart for rare vs wife time etc...
		- Forego “anytime” things like books or movies for “windowed” opportunities that may not come back. 
		- Scarcity. urgency. limited windows
		- (Essentialism: If this opportunity wasn't on your plate right now,
		what would you give to have this opportunity? Helps you assess value)
		Every decision you make has a cost.

	Books:
	- "Alchemy" by @rorysutherland.
	- https://t.co/Z9YYJJZVFF (art of the good life.)
	- Art of thinking clearly
Speaking of ego, if you want to learn more about shedding your ego and being an even-keeled PM, there’s no better book than “The Practicing Stoic” by Ward Farnsworth.

### Visually Communicate effectively
- Diagramming (TODO PRACTICE frequently. Start capturing
[principles](../visualizations-graphics-diagrams/diagramming-first-principles-of-diagramming.md) around it)

- [Visualizing programming concepts / abstract state
changes](../visualizations-graphics-diagrams/visualizing-programming-concepts-flow-blocks.md)

- Feynman principles

## Lower priority
### Drawing and writing by hand (and "thinking visually")

- Use lined or gridded paper (I LOVE the grid paper)
- Repetition. Keep working at it!
- Warm up by practicing writing the whole alphabet
- SLOW DOWN
- When Sketchnoting, DON'T Transcribe. Use as few words as possible, with images to capture the most important ideas.
- Tweak troubled letters (for greater speed and consistency)
