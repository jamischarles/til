Like COC in vim. Basically something that assists in learning & writing the
language. Like a incremental compiler... Basically like what Rust has on replit.
Really cool.

Would love to build something like that for JS that works really well and is
targeted esp at beginners...

Maybe lints for basic errors, and common issues for beginners.
