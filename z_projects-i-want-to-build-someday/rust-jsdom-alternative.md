# JSDom alternative written in rust...
Super simple. Super fast. No event bindings (or maybe even generate the client
side code for that?)

Basically we're talking about writing a DOM->HTML parser...

Maybe I can just take 1/10th of the features... What if we don't need traversal?

JUST to generate dom elements... 

Q: Could I just write this?
