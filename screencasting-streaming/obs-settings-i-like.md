# OBS Settings I like for recording screencasts 

(and my learnings?)

## Important principles to understand

## Video settings

## Audio Settings

TODO: Pipe audio through Reaper?

Workflow to consider: 
OBS + Reaper (for editing and output)

Try that ^ vs OBS + Davinci...


## Interesting workflows

### Reaper -> OBS
Capture Audio in Reaper and add noise gates, compression etc and the output is
then piped to OBS (worked really well.) Required using Loopback by Rogue Amoeba
to be able to send Reaper output as System output which OBS could capture. 

This is a nice & fast workflow. No / very little editing required.

Only downside: Delay in audio coming into OBS, but this is fixable I'm sure...
Maybe we can add a sync delay on the video capture when using reaper. Or
compensate in reaper for it somehow...
