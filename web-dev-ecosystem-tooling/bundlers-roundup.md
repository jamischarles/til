# Which bundler should I use

Tried rollup today. On replit it was REALLY nice to use... 
```bash
# compile to a <script> containing a self-executing function ('iife')
rollup main.js --file bundle.js --format iife
```
And this is WITHOUT a config file. Wow!


I still like parcel a lot.

## Want to try
- Astro
- Parcel
- Rollup

## Want to avoid
- Webpack
