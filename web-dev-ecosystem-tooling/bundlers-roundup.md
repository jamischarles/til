# Which bundler should I use

Tried rollup today. On replit it was REALLY nice to use... 
```bash
# compile to a <script> containing a self-executing function ('iife')
rollup main.js --file bundle.js --format iife
```
And this is WITHOUT a config file. Wow!


I still like parcel a lot.

## Want to try & inital impressions
- Astro
- Parcel
- Rollup
- Swc

* Snowpack - interesting, but changing config was too complex for me. Couldn't
figure out changing folder config. Also felt slow.
* Vite

Most excited about:
- Vite - Uses html as entry point to go from (like parcel)
- Parcel

## Want to avoid
- Webpack
