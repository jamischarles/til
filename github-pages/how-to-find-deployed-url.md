# How to find the url of your github pages 

If you've activated GH pages then you should see this `Github pages` link on your repo.

![Alt text](images/env_github-pages-link.png "GitHub pages link")

Click on this link. Then click on the `view deployment` button.

That will take you to your deployed GH site.

OR

You can convert the url of the repo.
`https://github.com/jamischarles/til`
would map to (assuming there's a github pages site pointed there)
`https://jamischarles.github.io/til`

So the formula is
`https://github.com/[github_username]/[folder]`
to
`https://[github_username].github.io/[folder]`
