# Explain my stacktrace

Paste in your stacktrace and it visually splits it out for you and explains each
part. You can hover and explain (bubbles?).

Bonus:
Paste the file in as well and have it generate a nice readable path part...

Sort of like pair programming with a sr dev. Points out all the important parts
and walks you through it.
