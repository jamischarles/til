If you have a page that's showing a stale cache you have a few options to bust
the cache:

a) open devtools (right click on page and click `inspect`. On the Network tab check the `disable cache` checkbox

b) You can long-press the refresh button on your browser. `Hard refresh` (hm...
long press isn't working for me...)
