# How to interop across languages


After compiling a c program for your system (architecture), you can run the outputted program as an executable.  

You can also reference that from a rust program via bindings.

If possible use a static library, so it doesn't have to perform the linking at runtime.   


## .dylib files are shared libraries 
This is a DYNAMIC library (harder?) 

> NOTE: Itâ€™s highly recommended that you build libgit2 as a static library for Xcode projects. This simplifies distribution significantly, as the resolution of dynamic libraries at runtime can be extremely problematic.

You can share these across langs.
