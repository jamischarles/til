# Modern replacements for linux(and macos) terminal commands

## Old and new

- `grep -> rg` (ripgrep)
- `ls -> exa`
- `cat -> bat`
- `vim -> nvim` (neovim)
- `cd` -> `z` (try zoxide) https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide

## No replacement?
- `fx` JSON viewer
- `glow` Markdown preview (`bat` isn't bad either...) (WOW) amazing for
	discovering md files to read in the folder tree
- `fzf` Super fast fuzzy finder for any list input
- `z` cd with fuzzer finder and frecency baked in
