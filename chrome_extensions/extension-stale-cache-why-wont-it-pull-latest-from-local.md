## Order Matters!
Close all the inspector windows (because those will prevent the SWs from
shutting down).

Then refresh the extension.

You could also try manaully stopping and un-registering the SW: chrome://serviceworker-internals

## Hard refresh
If all else fails you can do a hard refresh by removing the exension and loading
it back in.
