# Show don't tell

Don't tell them your plans. Do it (in a small/fast way), then show them.

There is a transfer of energy when you tell somebody something you are excited about.

Use that energy on creating something small instead. THEN show them. 

Now you have something tangible. Something of value. Something permanent. And you've gained
experience and explored more of the map. 1000% more value.

This provides momentum to push you forward again...

When I jump into replit and just code something, more often than not I have an
80% solution within several hours. Which is incredibly rewarding, exciting, and
motivating. Then I can decide if I want to invest further. it also frees up my
mind to tackle other things. That blocking thought has been addressed and given
the attention it needs.
