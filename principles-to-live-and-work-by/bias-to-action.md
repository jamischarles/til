# Bias to Action 

Whenever I think 'Hey I should do X'. If I write it down that's usually all it becomes: 
A plan. If instead I crack open replit, and start coding, more often than not, 3-5 hours 
later I have something that solves 80% of the problem and works well enough. The value of 
that is infinitely higher. I've pushed myself forward. I have a tiny experiment that 
taught me something that I can now build on. THIS is bias to action.
