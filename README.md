## His guidelines
```md
1. It was tightly constrained. I limited posts to 200 words or less. They needed to be very focused to fit within that word limit.
2. It took a small amount of time. It always took me 10 to 15 minutes which always felt manageable, even on a busy day.
3. I did it on the clock. Part of my job as software developer and consultant is to learn. There is simply too much to know, so learning has to happen on the job. By making this part of my work routine, it was easy to do everyday.
