I'd LOVE to try out a hardware dial for editing in davinci and other recording /
editing related tasks...

## Some really decent options
Each one is priced to cheapest product with a dial
https://loupedeck.com/us/

$279.00 for Loupedeck+ new


Blackmagic Design DaVinci Resolve Speed Editor 
$395 new
$190.00 on ebay used
https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/keyboard


Monogram
STUDIO CONSOLE $499 new
https://monogramcc.com/shop/

Plug & play composable pieces. Really interesting but more pricey...


Budget dial option $60 (might be a nice one to start with and try out...)
