TIL: You need a 4k monitor at least for it to look good with retina and not feel
like the text is blurry.


> 4k has 3840x2160 pixels, ppi is pixels per inch. So would need to know how many inches wide your screen is (a 55″ tv is 55″ from top corner to bottom corner, not 55″ wide).

> 3840 / inches width = ppi
