# What mic should I use

This review was awesome: https://fizzle.co/podcast-high-quality-microphone-shootout/

Based on that I chose the  *Audio Technical AT875R shotgun mic*. It is VERY
directional and is good at rejecting sound from other directions (including
sound bouncing off the ceiling etc (reverb)).
